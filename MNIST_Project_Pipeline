MNIST Classification using Deep Learning
This project focuses on classifying the MNIST dataset using deep learning. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was used for this task, with experiments on different architectures and hyperparameters.

Key Achievements:
Implemented functions for training (train_one_epoch) and evaluation (evaluate).
Built and tested a CNN architecture for image classification.
Achieved 98% accuracy on the test set after tuning the model.
Experimented with various architectures and hyperparameters for improved performance.
Technologies Used:
Python, PyTorch (or TensorFlow), Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab.
